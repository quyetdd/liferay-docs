# System Check

[TOC levels=1-4]

During development, all kinds of strange things can happen in the OSGi
container. Liferay's `system:check` 
[Gogo shell](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/using-the-felix-gogo-shell)
command can help you see what's happening. You can enable it to run as the last
Portal startup step and you can execute it any time in Gogo shell. 

`system:check` aggregates these commands:

-  [`ds:unsatisfied`](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/detecting-unresolved-osgi-components#dsunsatisfied-command):
    Reports unsatisfied Declarative Service components.

-  [`dm na`](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/detecting-unresolved-osgi-components#dm-na-command):
    Reports unsatisfied Dependency Manager service components, including Service
    Builder services. 

System checking functionality from future Liferay tools will be added to
`system:check`.

[Developer mode](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/using-developer-mode-with-themes)
runs `system:check` automatically on every startup. 

You can enable `system:check` to run on startup outside of developer mode by
setting this property in your `portal-ext.properties` file:

    module.framework.properties.initial.system.check.enabled=true

As stated previously, you can run the `system:check` command any time in
[Gogo shell](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/using-the-felix-gogo-shell).
Enjoy detecting unresolved components and other issues fast using
`system:check`.
