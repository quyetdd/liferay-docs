# JAX-RS and JAX-WS

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can deploy JAX-RS and JAX-WS web services and consume them much as you would
outside of @product@. There are, however, a few things you should know,
particularly with regard to deploying them into @product@'s OSGi container. The
tutorials in this section discuss these things and show you how to use JAX-RS
and JAX-WS in @product@.
