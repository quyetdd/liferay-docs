# Themes and Layout Templates

[TOC levels=1-4]

A Theme provides the overall look and feel for a site. 
[Understanding the page layout](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/understanding-the-page-layout) 
is crucial to targeting the correct markup for styling, organizing your
content, and creating your site. Once you understand how the page is organized,
you can develop your theme.

If you want to design a website, you must have three key components: CSS,
JavaScript, and HTML. @product@ provides 
[CSS extensions and patterns out-of-the-box](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-components-and-workflow#css-frameworks-and-extensions) 
and supports SASS, as well as multiple JavaScript frameworks. The HTML, however, is 
rendered via 
[FreeMarker](https://freemarker.apache.org/) 
theme templates.

@product@ provides several 
[default FreeMarker templates](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-components-and-workflow#theme-templates) 
that each handle a key piece of functionality for the page. To help make the 
development process easier, @product@ also provides several 
[theme template utilities](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-components-and-workflow#theme-template-utilities) 
that you can use in your theme templates to include portlets, use taglibs, 
access theme objects, and more.

There are several mechanisms for 
[customizing and extending themes](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-components-and-workflow#theme-customizations-and-extensions), 
from color schemes to reusable pieces of code. Likewise, there are several mechanisms 
for 
[customizing and extending portlets](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/theme-components-and-workflow#portlet-customizations-and-extensions). 

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how to develop themes and layout
templates, customize portlets, and more.
