is a design language that provides a common framework for building consistent 
UIs.
[Clay](https://claycss.com/), 
the web implementation of Lexicon, is an extension of Bootstrap's open source 
CSS Framework. Bootstrap is by far the most popular CSS framework on the web. 
Built with Sass, Clay CSS fills the front-end gaps between Bootstrap and the 
specific needs of @product@.
