# Developing Themes

[TOC levels=1-4]

Theme projects created using the 
[Liferay Theme Generator](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/creating-themes) 
have access to several 
[gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) 
tasks you can execute to manage and develop your theme. This section of 
tutorials covers the available actions that these tasks provide, as well as 
other information you may find useful while developing your theme.
