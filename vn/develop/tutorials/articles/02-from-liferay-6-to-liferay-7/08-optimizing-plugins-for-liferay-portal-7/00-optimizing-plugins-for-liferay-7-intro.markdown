# Optimizing Plugins for @product-ver@

[TOC levels=1-4]

Once you've
[upgraded your plugin](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/upgrading-plugins-to-liferay-7), 
you can optimize it to take advantage of all @product-ver@
offers. If you haven't yet familiarized yourself with
[what's changed from Liferay Portal 6](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/whats-changed-and-what-hasnt),
the
[new benefits for developers](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/benefits-of-liferay-7-for-liferay-6-developers),
[OSGi and modularity](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/osgi-and-modularity-for-liferay-6-developers),
and the
[improved tooling](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/improved-developer-tooling-liferay-workspace-maven-plugins-and-more),
make sure to do so as they'll help you understand and appreciate the optional
improvements for plugins and plugin development these tutorials demonstrate. 

Here are some common optimizations to consider:

-   Migrating to environments that help you develop and test
    more quickly, such as the
    [Liferay Theme Generator](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/migrating-a-6-2-theme-to-liferay-7)
    for themes and
    [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/from-the-plugins-sdk-to-liferay-workspace)
    for modules and web applications. 
-   Adapting plugins to
    [Liferay's modular architecture](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/whats-changed-and-what-hasnt#embracing-a-modular-architecture)
    and updated frameworks, such as Service Builder.
-   [Styling your app consistently using Clay](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/applying-clay-styles-to-your-app)
    --the web implementation of Lexicon, Liferay's design language.
-   Modularizing apps to reap the
    [benefits of modularity](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/benefits-of-liferay-7-for-liferay-6-developers).
