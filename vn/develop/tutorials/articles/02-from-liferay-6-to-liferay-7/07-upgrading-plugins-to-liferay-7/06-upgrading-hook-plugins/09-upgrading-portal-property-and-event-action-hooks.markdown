# Upgrading Portal Property and Event Action Hooks

[TOC levels=1-4]

All portal properties in Liferay Portal 6.2 that are also used in @product-ver@
can be overridden. Portal property and portal event action hooks that use these
properties can be upgraded by following these steps:

1.  Adapt your code to @product-ver@'s API using the Liferay Upgrade Planner. When
    you ran the planner's *Fix Upgrade Problems* step, many of the existing
    issues were autocorrected or flagged. For any remaining errors, consult the
    [Resolving a Plugin's Dependencies](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/resolving-a-plugins-dependencies)
    article.

2.  Deploy your hook plugin. 

@product@'s Plugin Compatibility Layer converts the plugin WAR to a Web
Application Bundle (WAB) and installs it to Liferay's OSGi Runtime. 

Your custom property values and actions are live.
