# Using Xamarin with Liferay Screens

[TOC levels=1-4]

Liferay Screens for 
[Android](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/android-apps-with-liferay-screens) 
and 
[iOS](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/ios-apps-with-liferay-screens) 
lets you use *Screenlets* to develop native mobile apps on each platform. 
Screenlets are complete visual components that you insert in your app to 
leverage @product@'s content and services. Since Liferay Screens 3.0, you can 
use Screenlets with 
[Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/) 
to develop hybrid mobile apps for Android and iOS. 

The tutorials in this section show you how to develop hybrid mobile apps using 
Liferay Screens and Xamarin. You'll start by preparing your Xamarin project for 
Screens. You'll then learn how to use Screenlets in Xamarin, customize their 
appearance, and more. 

| **Note:** These tutorials assume that you know how to use Xamarin. If you need
| assistance with Xamarin, see
| [its documentation](https://developer.xamarin.com/).
