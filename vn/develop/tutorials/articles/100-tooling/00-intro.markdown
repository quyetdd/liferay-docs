# Tooling

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can write code for Liferay using any standard toolset. Liferay is
tool-agnostic, rather than pigeonholing you into something specific. This frees
you to work with whatever you're already productive using.

Liferay has also created its own tools that streamline @product@ development.
These tools integrate with popular build environments (e.g., Gradle and Maven).
They include

- [Liferay @ide@](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/liferay-ide): an
  Eclipse-based IDE supporting development for @product@.
- [Blade CLI](/docs/7-0/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/blade-cli): a command line
  interface bootstrapped on to a Gradle based environment that is used to build
  and manage Liferay Workspaces and @product@ projects.
- [Liferay Workspace](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/liferay-workspace):
  a generated environment built to hold and manage @product@ projects.
- [Liferay IntelliJ plugin](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/intellij-idea):
  a plugin providing support for @product@ development with IntelliJ IDEA.

Liferay also provides a plethora of
[Gradle](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/gradle) and
[Maven plugins](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/maven) you can apply to
your projects. Many of these are already built into tools such as Liferay
Workspace.

Want samples or predefined project templates? Liferay has you covered with 30+
[project templates](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/project-templates)
and many more
[project samples](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/sample-projects).

If you're a newbie looking for the best development tool for @product@, or even
a seasoned veteran looking for a tool you may like more than your current setup,
this section will answer your tooling questions.
