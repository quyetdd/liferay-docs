# Using Front-End Frameworks in Your portlets

[TOC levels=1-4]

You can use the most popular Front-End frameworks in your portlets with just a 
few minor updates to the standard portlet configuration. To help kick-start your 
portlet project, you can choose from several 
[Blade portlet project templates](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/project-templates). 
The following templates are covered in this section:

- Angular
- React
- Vue

Alternatively, you can 
[use @product@'s Liferay JS Generator](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/creating-and-bundling-javascript-portlets-with-javascript-tooling) 
to build JavaScript-based portlets. The tutorials in this section show how to 
use front-end frameworks in your portlets.

| **Note:** JavaScript Server-Side-Rendering is not supported out-of-the-box. To
| use JS frameworks for site rendering, you **must** set up your server-side
| (or search-crawler) rendering generation to support them.
