# Liferay Forms

[TOC levels=1-4]

The [Liferay Forms](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/forms) application is
a full-featured form building tool for collecting data. There's lots of built-in
functionality, and for the pieces you're missing, there's lots of extensibility.

This section of tutorials shows developers how to

1.  Store form entry data in an alternative format. The default storage type is
    JSON.

2.  Create new form field types.

This list will continue to grow as new tutorials on customizing and extending
Liferay Forms are written.
