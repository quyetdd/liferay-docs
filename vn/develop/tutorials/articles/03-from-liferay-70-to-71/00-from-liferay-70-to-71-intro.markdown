# From @product@ 7.0 to 7.1

[TOC levels=1-4]

@product-ver@ offers new and improved frameworks and APIs that make your plugins
faster, more secure, and easier to maintain. Upgrading plugins from @product@
7.0 to 7.1 is easier than ever too. These tutorials show you how:

- [Upgrading Plugins](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/upgrading-plugins-from-liferay-7-0-to-7-1)
- [Upgrading Themes](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/upgrading-7-0-themes-to-7-1)
- [Upgrading Layout Templates](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/upgrading-7-0-layout-templates-to-7-1)

Upgrading plugins (portlets, customizations, and extensions) is up first.
