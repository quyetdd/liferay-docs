# Front-End Taglibs

[TOC levels=1-4]

You have access to a powerful set of taglibs for creating commonly used UI
components in your apps, themes, and web content. The following taglibs are 
covered in this section of tutorials:

- AUI: lets you create common UI components such as forms, buttons, and more.

- Chart: visualizes data. You can create bar charts, line charts, scatter 
  charts, spline charts, and much more. 

- Clay: lets you add 
[Clay components](https://clayui.com/docs/components/alerts.html), 
  such as alerts, buttons, drop-down menus, form elements, and more to your apps. 

- Frontend: Lets you create UI components commonly used throughout Portal's 
  apps, such as add menus, cards, management bars, and more.

- Liferay UI: lets you create common UI components such as icons, tabs, and 
  more.

| **Note:** Each taglib is available as a FreeMarker macro, except for the Chart
| taglib. The Chart taglib is **not** available as a FreeMarker macro. The
| tutorials in this section provide the proper syntax to use for each macro. See
| the
| [FreeMarker Taglib Mappings reference](/docs/7-1/reference/-/knowledge_base/r/freemarker-taglib-macros)
| for a complete list of the available FreeMarker taglib macros.

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn how to use taglibs to build awesome 
user interfaces for your apps!
