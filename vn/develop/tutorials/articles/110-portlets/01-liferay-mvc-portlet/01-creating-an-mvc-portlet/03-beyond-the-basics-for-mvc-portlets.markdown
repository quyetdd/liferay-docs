# Beyond the Basics for Portlets

[TOC levels=1-4]

The tutorial you've just completed should get you up and running with a Liferay
MVC Web module, but there's more to know about creating an app in Liferay. To
support more actions, complex render logic, and or serving resources, continue
reading the MVC command tutorials that follow. 

Regardless of your application's size or complexity, there are more conveniences
and features to leverage in your portlets. Here are a few useful jumping off
points:

-  [Making URLs Friendlier](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/making-urls-friendlier)
-  [Applying Clay Styles to your App](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/applying-clay-styles-to-your-app)
-  [Localizing your Application](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/localizing-your-application)
-  [Liferay's Workflow Framework](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/liferays-workflow-framework)
-  [Model Listeners](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/model-listeners)

-  [Asset Framework](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/asset-framework)
-  [Service Builder](/docs/7-1/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/t/service-builder)

Enjoy creating your own portlets!
