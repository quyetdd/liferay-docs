# Page Fragments

[TOC levels=1-4]

Page Fragments are templates made up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript used to build
Content Pages. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all completely standard, just 
like anywhere else on the web, but are also enhanced with Liferay-specific 
features. The articles in this section provide additional information about the
Liferay-specific features of Page Fragments.
