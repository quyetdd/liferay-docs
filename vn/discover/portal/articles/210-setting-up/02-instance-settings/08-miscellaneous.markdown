# Miscellaneous Settings

[TOC levels=1-4]

The Miscellaneous tab of Control Panel &rarr; Configuration &rarr; Instance
Settings contains display settings and a few integration configurations.

## Miscellaneous: Display Settings

Set the default instance language and time zone. You can also choose an
instance-wide logo that appears in the top left corners of pages. 

When configuring a new logo, be careful to choose an image file that fits the
space. Large images might overlap with the navigation. 

## Miscellaneous: Integrations

In the Miscellaneous tab below the Display Settings form, there are
three additional configuration forms for these integrations:

**Analytics**: Enter an analytics system or remove one of the two
pre-configured options (`google` and `piwik`). Activate these systems here, and
configure them at the 
[site level](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/advanced-site-settings#analytics).

**Maps**: Choose OpenStreetMap or Google Maps as the maps API provider for
geolocalized asset display.

**Google Apps**: Specify the Google Apps API Key and Google Client ID to
integrate Google Apps.
