# Using the Staging Environment

[TOC levels=1-4]

After [enabling staging](/docs/7-1/user/-/knowledge_base/u/enabling-staging)
(either Local Live or Remote Live) for a site, you'll notice additional options
provided on the top Control Menu (Staging Bar) and also in the menu to the left.
These new menus help you manage staged pages. Most of your page management
options have also been removed; now you can't directly edit live pages. You now
must use the staging environment to make changes.

Click the *Staging* button to view the staged area. Management options are
restored and you can access some new options related to staging.

To test out the staging environment, add the Bookmarks widget and then click on
*Live* from the top menu. Notice that the Bookmarks widget isn't there. That's
because you've staged a change to the page but haven't published that change yet
to the live site.

Next, you'll learn the basics of staging content.
