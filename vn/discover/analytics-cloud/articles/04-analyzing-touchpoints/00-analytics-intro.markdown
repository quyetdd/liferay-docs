# Finding Analytics Data

Combining traditional Page Analytics with Path and Asset Analytics sets Liferay
Analytics Cloud apart from other analytics tools.

Traditional Page Analytics, such as Views, Visitors, and Bounce Rate, provide
lots of information about how visitors interact with your site's pages. Liferay
Analytics offers that functionality, but also provides a novel set of metrics
for your site pages in the form of Path Analytics. In addition, several
@product@ Assets have even more fine-grained metrics to drill deeper than the
page level to determine how you can improve the performance of your site.

This tutorial shows where to find the analytics for Pages and Assets. The 
remaining tutorials explain their metrics. 

## Viewing Page Data

1.  Find the Touchpoints section of the menu.

2.  Click *Pages* to view the list of Pages with summary data.

![Figure 2: The Page list contains useful summary data.](../../images/pages-list.png)

Order Pages in ascending or descending order based on any one of these metrics. 
Click the metric's heading in the table to perform the sort: 

-   Average Engagement Score
-   Total Visitors
-   Total Views
-   Average Bounce Rate
-   Average Time on Page

The metrics for ordering the Page list are calculated based on the time period
selected in the time period menu (at the top-right of the table). The following 
values are supported: 

-   Last 24 hours
-   Yesterday
-   Last 7 days
-   Last 28 days
-   Last 30 days (default)
-   Last 90 days

To view detailed metrics for a single page, click that page in the table. See 
[Page Analytics](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/blob/7.1.x/discover/analytics-cloud/articles/04-analyzing-touchpoints/01-page-analytics.markdown) 
for more information.

## Finding Asset Data

1.  Find the Touchpoints section of the menu. 

2.  Click *Assets* for a list of Assets with summary data. 

3.  Choose an Asset type: Blogs, Documents and Media, Forms, Web Content, or 
    Custom.

To order Assets in ascending or descending order based on any one of the Asset's 
metrics, click the metric's heading in the table. The metrics differ between 
Assets. See each Asset's documentation for more information. In addition, you 
can calculate the metrics over a selected time period by selecting one of the 
following values from the time period menu (at the top-right of the table): 

-   Last 24 hours
-   Yesterday
-   Last 7 days
-   Last 28 days
-   Last 30 days (default)
-   Last 90 days

Click an Asset in the list to see more granular detail. Remember that there are 
separate lists for different Asset types. More details on each Asset type's 
metrics are covered in the subsequent articles.
